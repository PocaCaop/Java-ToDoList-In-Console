#### Create task

Just input the name of the task and a description and you will have your task created.

#### Check tasks

This option allows you to see all your todos


#### Mark Task as done

Input the number option you want to mark as done and the task will be deleted so you can focus on your todos.

#### Modify your ToDos

You can change the name and description of an specfic task to fix typos or whatever you want (it will stay in the same position)

### Your TODOS are automatically saved after you quit the program and loaded automatically when you open it again!


### Enjoy and have fun :video_game:
